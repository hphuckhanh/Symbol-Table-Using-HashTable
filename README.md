# Symbol-Table-Using-HashTable
## Introduction
Symbol table is a crucial data structure, made and maintained by compilers to trace semantics
of identifiers (e.g information about name, type, scope, e.t.c).

In the previous assignment, students were required to implement the simulations of symbol
table via list and tree. To optimize searching progress, hash table is among one of the most
suitable data structures. Moreover, in this assignment, students are also introduced how to build
a symbol table for languages using type inference. Type inference programming languages, in
general, is a programming language, in which, when declaring identifiers, it does not require
explicitly declare the corresponding types. However, the way that type of an identifier is set is
related to statements or expressions, in which the identifier is used.

In this assignment, students are required to implement a simulation of a symbol table,
using hash table data structures.
